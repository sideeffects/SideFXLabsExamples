# SideFX Labs Examples - Houdini 20.5

This repository hosts the example files, demo projects, and other learning contents created for SideFX Labs.

## What Is SideFX Labs

SideFX Labs is a free, open-source toolset geared towards assisting Houdini users with a variety of tasks commonly used for digital content creation. It is an all-inclusive toolset that spans the shelf, digital assets, custom desktops and scripts and more. The toolset is currently maintained by Mai Ao, Danicka Oglesby, Christos Stavridis, Mohamad Salame, and Bailey Hogan. It also receives a lot of contributions from the always active Houdini community. The toolset originated from the GameDevelopmentToolset, which was rebranded in the Houdini 18.0 release.
